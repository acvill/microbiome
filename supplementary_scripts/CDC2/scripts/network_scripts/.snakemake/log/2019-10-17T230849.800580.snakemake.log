Job 4: ---trans

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 20 of /local/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/scripts/network_scripts/snake_trans_with_network:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/hicpro/output/B314-1_output/hic_results/data/B314-1/B314-1_trans_primary_0_ncol_noeuks.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job get_trans_noeuks_phagerepair since they might be corrupted:
/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/logs/finals/B314-1_trans_final
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
