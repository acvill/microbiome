Job 1: ---bwafilter

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 93 of /local/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/scripts/mapping/snake_bwa_rpkm:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/mapping/B314-1/B314-1.nss.sam
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job filter since they might be corrupted:
/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/mapping/B314-1/B314-1.nss.filtered.sam, /workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/mapping/B314-1/B314-1.nss.filtered.bam, /workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/mapping/B314-1/done_filtered_scaffolds
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
