# microbiome
This repository represents a long project investigating antibiotic resistance and mobile genes in the human microbiome using proximity ligation and high throughput sequencing (Hi-C).

Most scripts have been somewhat hard-coded for use in a cluster environment and for specific use in this project, i.e. sample ids have been employed for plotting purposes. So if using, please be aware of that. There are also likely many scripts of analyses that did not make it into the final project.
