This repository is a fork of [alyssagkent/microbiome](https://github.com/alyssagkent/microbiome) containing additional scripts used in the analysis and figure production for our publication: [Widespread transfer of mobile antibiotic resistance genes within individual gut microbiomes revealed through bacterial Hi-C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18164-7). 

Many of the scripts contain hard-coded directory structures and sample names. Some of the snakemake pipelines in [`/scripts`](https://github.com/acvill/microbiome/tree/master/scripts) rely on helper scripts in [`/supplementary_scripts`](https://github.com/acvill/microbiome/tree/master/supplementary_scripts). There are likely duplicate scripts across directories.
