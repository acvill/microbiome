Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 36 of /local/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/scripts/binning_scripts/snake_bwa_scaffold_t2:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/mapping/mapping_t2/B357-5/filtered
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job primary_filter since they might be corrupted:
/workdir/users/agk85/CDC2/mapping/mapping_t2/B357-5/B357-5.nss.sam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
